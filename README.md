# metrolympiade

Metrolympiade is a web application designed to streamline the organization of team-building events focused on sports. Previously, the company relied on Excel sheets and manual methods to track scores, organize matches, and display leaderboards. This year, they decided to adopt a modern application to manage the event more efficiently.

The application allows team leaders to register their teams, manage matches, and record scores. Each match involves two teams, a specific activity, and a scheduled time. The leaderboard system tracks the progress of all teams throughout the day, awarding 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The leaderboard is accessible to everyone, including unauthenticated users.

This project was built using Vue 3 and Vite to provide a fast and user-friendly experience for managing team-building events.

(This project was developed as part of a school assignment)
